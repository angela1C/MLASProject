    "In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make pre- dictions based on the data set powerproduction available on Moodle. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items.\n",
    "1. Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you should explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.\n",
    "2. Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.\n",
    "3. Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.\n",
    "4. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.\n",
    "To enhance your submission, you might consider developing and comparing more than one model. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.\n",

    "The goal of this project is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. The first time I looked at this I was wondering if the data values represented measurements over a particular period of time and if the lower values of power might be related to the time taken for the turbines to get up and running before they could generate any power or if some of the zero power values were related to periodic maintenance when the turbines might get switched off. There does seem to be some linear relationship between the two variables for the middle portion of the dataset and the power generated does seem to level off after a particular point but overall the relationship is strong but non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "However looking at the raw data in the csv file, the rows are ordered by ascending values of speed column with the corresponding power values in the other column. There is no indication as to how the data values were collected and therefore I don't think I can make any judgements about the data over a particular timeframe. There are only two columns of numerical data provided with no indication provided as to their measurement units.  I will just focus on trying to use some algorithms to predict the power values based on the input values of speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- whether to keep all zeros in or out\n",
    "- scaling the input and output values\n",
    "- I trained a neural network with and without the zeros, definitely the learning curve looks much better when the zeros are dropped. I first only dropped the zero values for the very high speed values as the turbines would be switched off in dangerous winds. I then tried dropping all, then some!\n",
    "- I also need to look at the web app side of it so I won't get carried away on training the model until I have this up and running even if the model is not perfect. It seems to be a case of playing around with the parameters and it is surprising how well the NN models the data given only single numerical values fed into it.\n",
    "- dfx is a copy of df with some zeros dropped (speed values over 24.4)\n",
    "- dfz is a copy of df with all zeros dropped, or maybe it was zeros where power was over a certain value. Anyway its near the end of the notebook.\n",
    "- I will probably lose all the numpy polyfit regression models and maybe leave in the higher order polynomial using scikit learn.\n",
    "- I might look again at scikit learn to see if there are any other models to try. if I have time that it...\n",
    "- I do have docker installed.\n",
    "- I am following some machine learning mastery tutorials which are really informative. Also the keras for engineers.\n",
    "- cleaned up some unnecesary statistics below and consolidated the exploratory plots.\n",
    "- Need to tidy up the section on a brief background of wind turbines, just to see how it relates to the s-curve and not going into the physics of how wind turbines actually work. \n",
    "- I did the seabron regression plots on the full dataset so I might just try it quickly on the cleaned dataset without all the zero values.\n",
    "- Need to decide on final parameters for the keras neural network and save a model to use with a flask app.\n",
    "- Need to set up the flask app and virtual envirnoment. First clean up this notebook some more.\n",
    "- the h5 file does not seem to be correct. maybe there is another format to save it as.\n",

These methods can be univariate where one variable is looked at at a time or multivariate where two or more variables are looked at together to explore relationships. First I will do so some univariate EDA on both of the components before going on to do multivariate EDA. \n",

    "### The distribution of speed and power values\n",
    "Histograms are used to show the distribution of a single quantitative variable such as speed or power values, including the centre and spread of the distribution and if there is any skew in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram of wind speed looks to be uniformly distributed with wind speed values spread out from zero up to 25 which seems to be the max speed value. Power values on the other hand looks to be bimodal with two defined peaks, one around zero power values and the second around the 100 kilowatt mark. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wind turbine power values seem to have a peak at very low values. This is not surprising given the large number of zero power values in this dataset. Almost 10% of the power values supplied are zero.  There is another peak around values of 95-100. Most of the remaining power values fall between 18 and 85.\n",
    "A scatter plot can be used to see if there is any visible relationship between the two variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot shows a non-linear relationship between wind speed values and power. There does appear to be a linear relationship for mid-range speed values only.\n",
    "- When wind speed increases from very low levels, the power does not increase by much or at all. \n",
    "- The wind turbine power values does start to increase with the wind speed from wind speed values of about 5 to about 18/19. \n",
    "- From wind speeds of 20 onwards to about 25 the power values increase no further and seem to level off. \n",
    "\n",
    "From looking at the curves and knowing very little about wind, you would guess that at very low winds there may not be enough speed to get the turbine up and running and generating power and that there might be a maximum power that can be achieved by the wind turbine regardless of how high the wind can go. Once the turbine is in motion, little is required to keep it going. Some of the power generated might be consumed by the turbine itself at low levels to get it started."

    "### Summary statistics of the dataset\n",
    "When looking at quantitative variables such as wind speed and power values, the characteristics of interest are the centre, spread, modality (the number of peaks in the pdf), the shape of the distribution and the outliers.\n",
    "Panda's `describe` function generates statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a dataset’s distribution. (excluding NaN values)\n",
    "The central tendency or location of the data distribution is determined by the typical or middle values. While the mean value is the average value in the dataset it may not be typical of the values in the dataset if there are very small or very large values in the dataset. The median is another measure of central tendancy - it is the middle value after all the values are put in an ordered list.\n",
    "The mean and median are similar for symmetric distributions whereas for unimodal skewed distributions the mean will be more in the direction of the long tail of the distribution. \n",
    "The median can be considered a more typical value in the dataset or closer to some of the typical values and is also considered [robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics) which means that removing some of the data will not tend to change the value of the median. A few extreme values will not affect the median as they would affect the mean. \n",
    "In this dataset the mean and median wind speed values are similar at approx 12.5 to 12.6.\n",
    "The median power value is just over 41 compared to the mean power value of 48.\n",
    "As we saw above, there are many zero values for power in the dataset. At least 10% of the power values are zero and probably for valid reasons."

    "The percentiles or quartiles of the speed and power values can be used to see the spread of the data values. The Interquartile range (IQR) is calculated by taking the 75% percentile or 3rd quartile minus the 25% percentile or first quartile and captures half of the values, the middle values of the data. Data that is more spread out will have a higher IQR. The IQR is considered a more robust measure of spread than the variance and standard deviation and will be more clearly shown in the boxplots further down. The IQR does not consider the data below the 25% percentile or above the 75% percentile which may contain outliers. The statistics here show that the *power* variable in this dataset is much more spread out or variable than the *speed* variable.  "

    "The skewness of the data is a measure of assymetry which can be seen by the lopsidedness of a boxplot.\n",
    "Wind speed appears to be quite symmetric. The wind speed boxplot is cut pretty much in half by the median. Power appears to be soemwhat skewed to the right as the boxplot shows more of the box to the right or above the median line.\n",
    "A boxplot with the median closer to the lower quartile is considered positively skewed. Positively skewed data has the mean greater than the median and it can be interpreted as having a higher frequency of high valued scores. The lower values of power are closer together than the higher power values.\n"

    "The ordered pairs of numbers consisting of the independent variable wind 'speed' and the dependent variable 'power' output are plotted below resulting in a joint distribution of the two variables. Each point represents an actual observation is the dataset with a speed and a corresponding power value. \n",
    "The scatter plot shows an increasing linear trend in the middle range of the wind speed values. This would indicate that for increasing wind speeds in this range, power output values do increase, but only after a minimum wind speed has been reached. Power outputs then increase in line with increases in wind speed until it reaches a peak and plateaus."

    "#### Correlation and Covariance of Speed and Power values\n",
    " \n",
    "For two quantitative variables such as the wind speed and power values, the covariance and correlation can also be used to determine whether a linear relationship between variables does exist and to show if one variable tends to occur with large or small values of another variable. The correlation statistics puts a numerical value on the strength and direction of the relationship. The scatter plot shows a non-linear relationship between the variables. There appears to be a curved pattern in the data so the statistic cannot be taken on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance) is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables and the (Pearson) [correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) is the normalised version of the covariance which shows by its magnitude the strength of the linear relation. The covariance can be used to see how much two variables such as wind speed and wind turbine power vary with each other and in what direction turbine power output will move when wind speed value moves. \n",
    "If the covariance here is positive it would mean that when the wind speed measurement is above it's mean then the wind turbine power measurement will more than likely be above it's mean also and vice versa. \n",
    "If the covarince here is negative, when wind speed measurements are above their mean value, then the wind turbine power output is likely to be below its mean value.\n",
    "If there is a zero covariance (or a covariance value close to zero) this implies that the two variables wind speed and wind turbine output vary independently of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation statistics are computed from pairs of arguments. If there is a strong positive relationship between the wind speed and wind turbine power output variables, we would expect to see a correlation coefficient close to 1. A strong negative relationship would have a correlation coefficient value close to -1. A value close to zero would indicate that there is no relationship between the variables. The correlation is easier to interpret than the covariance as it does not depend on the units of measurement or which variable is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has functions for calculating the covariance and correlation coefficients. The correlation coefficient here of 0.85 shows there is a very strong positive relationship between the wind speed and turbine power output. It should be noted that correlation however is not the same as causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots show that the relationship is non-linear though. Maybe look at rand correlation.\n",

    "### Regression plots\n",
    "The Python Seaborn library has some regression plots that can be used to quickly visualise relationships and patterns that may exist in the data. They use statistical models to estimate a simple relationship between sets of observations and are mainly used to visualise patterns in a dataset during the exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "The scatter plot earlier showed a relationship between wind speeds and wind turbine power that is non-linear. There does seem to be a somewhat linear relationship for wind speeds between values of about 10 up to about 18 or so. Therefore it is worth looking at higher order polynomials as well as linear regression.\n",
    "The plot below shows that the polynomial with order 3 looks a much better fit to the line than the first or second order linear regression lines. "

    "### Drop most of this, just to explain the S-curve and the reasons for the zero values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of two columns each containing 500 floating numbers under the column names `speed` and `power`. There are no other features provided.  I'm not getting into too much specifics about wind turbines but some background would help in understanding the dataset and the relationship between wind speed and power output.\n",
    "The background to the project is related to wind farms supplying electricity to the supply grid and negotiating prices in advance.  In the electricity market, producers of electricity usually sell their electricity ahead of time and enter into a contract where they agree to produce a certain number of kilowatts of electricity during at a certain time, maybe between 11am one day and the next. The price is negotiated in advance of generating electricity and pushing it onto the supply grid. \n",
    "It is easier for those burning coal or gas or doing nuclear fusion to burn the right amount to generate the right amount of electricity. However with wind turbines you cannot tell how much electricity you will generate tomorrow because your generation of electricity depends on wind power. Therefore you can make an estimate by getting some meterological data from a weather prediction agent such as Met Eireann and use the weather prediction to help you predict how much electricity you are likely to produce. The prediction may not always be correct but you aim to reduce how often your calculations are wrong. The aim is to be able to predict that when wind speed is X amount that the power produced from the turbines is Y amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "A little research here suggests that the wind speed values are measured in metres per second and that the power values are measured in kilowatts.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA)](https://www.iwea.com/about-us/about-us) is the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country’s low-carbon energy future. They note here that in 2018 wind energy provided 29 per cent of Ireland’s electricity. Each quarter, both EirGrid and ESBN publish updated wind farm statistics for Ireland at [ESBN Connected Wind Farms](https://www.esbnetworks.ie/new-connections/generator-connections/generator-connection-statistics). There is currently 4,130 MW of installed capacity in ROI and new Eirgrid link here http://www.eirgridgroup.com/how-the-grid-works/renewables/\n",
    "\n",
    "Also on this website is a question about how much electricity a turbine generates. (See FAQ 16.)\n",
    ">The amount of electricity a turbine can generate depends on the type of turbine and the wind conditions at any time. There are many different models of turbines that can generate different amounts of electricity. Ireland’s largest wind farm is the Galway Wind Park in Connemara. The turbines there are 3 MW turbines. To use them as an example, when the wind is blowing steadily they can each generate 3 MW of electricity. A megawatt (MW) is a unit of energy.A single megawatt is equivalent to around 1,000 kilowatts. Boiling a kettle, for example, takes around two kilowatts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another website of interest is Eirgrid's [Smart grid dashboard](http://smartgriddashboard.eirgrid.com/#all/about).\n",
    "The [dashboard](http://smartgriddashboard.eirgrid.com/#all/wind)shows actual and forecast wind generation by day, week and month for allwind farms on the system. [sem-o.com](https://www.sem-o.com/links/) also some links as well as Ireland's open data portal at  data.gov.ie and the [EU Open data portal](https://data.europa.eu)\n",
    "\n",
    "[WindEurope](https://windeurope.org/data-and-analysis/) has facts and issues about wind energy in Europe, in particular the section on [Wind Energy Basics](https://windeurope.org/about-wind/wind-basics/). Wind is caused by three things, the heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the rotation of the Earth and the Earth's surface irregularities. *air under high pressure moves toward areas of low pressure – and the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the air flows and the stronger the wind!* Energy is the ability to  do work and can be categorised into  either kinetic energy (the energy of moving objects)\n",
    "or potential energy (energy that is stored). Wind turbines take the kinetic energy that’s in the wind and convert that kinetic energy into mechanical power which is mostly used in the form of electricity.\n",
    "Wind energy captures the energy of the wind and converts it to electricity and is an alternative to burning fossil fuels. It comes from a natural and renewable resourse and it is clean as it produces no greenhouse gas, emits no air pollutants and uses very little water. \n",
    "A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into electricity. Their output ranges from as small as 100 kilowatts to as big as 12 megawatts.\n",
    "According to this website, there are three main variables determining how much electricity a turbine can produce,  wind speed, blade radius and air density. (We only have the values for wind speed in the dataset here so will have to assume that the other variables are constant)\n",
    "Stronger winds allow more electricity to be produced with higher turbines being more receptive to strong winds. **Wind turbines generate electricity at wind speeds of 4 – 25 metres per second** [123][Wind Energy Basics](https://windeurope.org/about-wind/wind-basics/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The article also outlines what happens when the wind doesn't blow. A wind farms location is usually chosen purposely and therefore when a wind turbine is not turning it is usually because of maintenance, or because it must be stopped for safety reasons in the case of strong winds or a storm. So safety and maintenances reasons do explain the zero power values we see in the data set at the very high values of wind. \n",
    "The article does note that while sometimes there might not be enough wind to turn a turbine, the wind energy is not lost as the wind energy can be stored  in energy storage systems  for later use whenever wind levels are low.\n",
    "I must look at this again - this could explain why there might be some higher values of power that look unusual compared to the norm for those levels of wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another article looks at [how to calculate power output of wind](https://www.windpowerengineering.com/calculate-wind-power-output/) and notes that most *U.S. manufacturers rate their turbines by the amount of power they can safely produce at a particular wind speed, usually chosen between 24 mph or 10.5 m/s and 36 mph or 16 m/s.*\n",
    "This indicates that the power values in the dataset are in metres per second.\n",
    "The article gives a formula that illustrates the factors important to the performance of a wind turbine and notes that the wind speed `V` has an exponent of 3 applied to it meaning that even small increases in wind speeds result in a large increase in power.\n",
    "$Power=k.Cp \\frac{1}{2}\\rho AV^3$  where P = power output in kilowatts, Cp = Maximum power coefficient, $\\rho$ is Air density, A = Rotor swept area, V = wind speed in mph, k = 0.000133 a constant to yield power in kilowatts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the article notes that although the calculation of wind power illustrates important features about wind turbines, the best measure of wind turbine performance is annual energy output. **The difference between power and energy is that power (kilowatts kW) is the rate at which electricity is consumed, while energy (kilowatt-hours kWh) is the quantity consumed.**\n",
    "I'm not sure if this makes a difference here for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blog post [calculating energy production from weather forecast in Python](https://medium.com/planet-os/calculating-energy-production-from-weather-forecast-in-python-3c990047daa) on medium.com use a linear equation to calculate ideal wind production. They do note that modeling results can be enhanced via statistical analysis of hyper-local time series such as meteorological data and energy production data but for this project we do not have any of this data available.\n",
    "Each wind turbine manufacturer provides an ideal energy production curve for their turbines.\n",
    "The article provides a brief overview which is taken from another article [Wind Turbine Power Curve Modeling Using\n",
    "Advanced Parametric and Nonparametric Methods](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/5165391/5433168/06894235.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular relevance to this projects is that a typical wind turbine has three main characteristic speeds, the cut-in speeds (Vc), rated speeds (Vr) and cut-out (Vs) speeds.  This helps explain the s-shaped curve we see for this dataset.\n",
    "- The turbine starts generating power when the wind speed reaches the cut-in value.\n",
    "- The rated speed is the wind speed at which the generator is producing the machine’s rated power.\n",
    "- The power generation is shut down to prevent defects and damage when the wind speed reaches the cut-out speed.\n",
    "Also the differences between the ideal power curves which just describe the potentially maximum output versus reality taking into account many factors as well as measurement variations.\n",
    "*In practice, however, wind turbines are never used under ideal conditions, and the empirical power curves could be substantially different from the theoretical ones due to the location of the turbine, air density, wind velocity distribution, wind direction, mechanical and control issues, as well as uncertainties in measurements.* [1234][Wind Turbine Power Curve Modeling Using\n",
    "Advanced Parametric and Nonparametric Methods](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/5165391/5433168/06894235.pdf) linked to from the article on medium.com.\n",
    "(I'm just making notes that may be relevant to this project)\n",
    "While the ideal power curves simply describe potentially maximum output, accuracy could be improved by using more accurate accurate weather forecasts or various statistical methods such as machine learning.

    "This article notes that real wind turbines do not achieve their theoretical limit as their performance is a function to of aerodynamics and the need to limit power capture once the rated generator power is reached, at ‘rated’ windspeed. \n",
    ">The generator power, turbine diameter and bladeshape are optimized based on site characteristics such as annual average wind speed and the wind speed distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Turbine manufacturers measure their turbine’s ‘powercurve’ (the relationship between power output and windspeed) at turbine test sites where it is calculated from 10 min averaged wind speed ($U=\\bar{\\mu}$) and power.\n",
    "*The typical power curves have an s-shape where at wind speeds less than rated the energy capture is approximately proportional to $U^3$ (known as Region II). At wind speeds above rated, the bladepitch and generator torque are actively controlled to limit the power to the generator’s rated power (Region III).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations in atmospheric conditions can lead to changes in turbine power output of 10% or more at the same wind speed. Turbulence and shear and not usually used in the power curves as they are considered  difficult to include in turbine power predictions. The article also mentions that because of intermittency in the wind, wind turbines typically produce 20%–40% of their maximum possible output over the course of a year. There is a lot of uncertainty  in predicting power generation from a turbine using local wind speed data. If the amount of energy is overestimated then the site might not be as profitable as expected while underestimating the energy available at a site might lead to a site not being developed at all. This study simulated the aerodynamic forces on the turbines blades and structures using an aerostructuraland simulator and  created 1796 10 minute wind fields from a stochastic turbulence simulator. The data from the wind fields from the simulations were used to form a database of 1796 observations of 10 min average power (the response) as a function of wind speed, turbulence intensity, and shear exponent (the forcing). \n",
    "\n",
    "They binned the power data into 1 m $s^1$ wide bins and included a plot (figure 3 in the article) of the power curve which shows a Region II between 0.3 metres per second and about 11.5 metres per second, region III is from end the end of region II up to 25 which correspond exactly with our dataset.\n",
    "(The power is in kilowatts though with max value of 1500 so maybe I have the wrong metrics here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Noted that *although the forcing variables are evenly distributed, variance in power is largest near rated wind speed. This sensitivity may result in large variation between predicted power output and observed power output. Furthermore, the mean power generated in simulations that include turbulence is lower than the no-turbulence cases near rated wind speed.*\n",
    "### Will be removing this mostly.\n",
    "#### wind speeds below 8 metres per second, between 7 and 8 metres per second\n",
    "At wind speeds below 8 m $s^{-1}$, power increases with turbulence intensity and shear. The increase in power due to turbulence arises because turbulent flow with mean speed $U$ carries more power than laminar flow of the same $U$. The changes in power output of +/-20% associated with turbulence are approximately half of the change due to a change in wind speed from 7 to 8 $m^{s−1}$.\n",
    "In contrast, at wind speeds just above and below rated speed, increasing turbulence intensity reduces power output as the turbine cannot capture the extra energy that gusts bring, but a short duration slow down to wind speeds below rated results in a loss of energy. As the mean wind speed increases, the total amount of time with the blades pitched toward feather increases and the wind turbine is more often operating at rated power. At wind speeds much greater than rated, larger turbulence intensities are required to reduce the output of the machine to less than rated power, regardless of shear. In Regions II and III, variation in $Ti$ impacts power performance more than variation in $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article next looked at using machine learning to predict power output under different conditions by incorporating turbulence intensity and wind shear into power prediction tools. They note that the power output from the turbine is not a linear function of wind speed and so linear regression is not an appropriate technique. Non-linear regression assumes that the relationships are constant throughout the model space (i.e. power output is always proportional to $U^n$ ), which is incorrect, so non-linear regression is also inappropriate. Also, as multivariate bins only work where the training data includes data in all bins this would be computationally or observationally more expensive. Instead they chose a machine learning technique `regression trees` for capturing non-linear changes in response to forcing. Regression trees are models that use simple branching question paths to predict an outcome based on inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The turbines responds differently to changes in shear and turbulence at different wind speeds. In Region II, at wind speeds below 8 m $s^−1$, power output increases by up to 10% as turbulence increases or as the magnitude of the shear increases. At wind speeds greater than 8 m $s^−1$ and in Region III, the regression tree modeled power is consistent with the simulated power output: power decreases as turbulence intensity increases and shows weak or no dependence on shear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article concludes:\n",
    ">simulations suggest and the model clearly demonstrates that the response of the turbine is a complex non-linear function of hub height wind speed, turbulence intensity, and rotor disk shear. At wind speeds below rated speed, the turbine power output is most sensitive to changes in wind speed and speed, turbulence. At rated speed, the turbine is most sensitive to turbulence intensity and shear, and power can change by 10% under typical atmospheric conditions. At wind speeds greater than rated, the turbine responds most to changes in turbulence intensity."

The research showed that there is a cut-out speed between 24 and 25 metres per second for safety reasons.  At the cut-out wind speed, the turbine shuts down to avoid damage. This is enough to justify excluding these observations as we can predict that the power output will be zero when the wind speed exceeds this cut out value. There are only ten observations in the dataset that fall into this range.\n",

These mostly occur below a certain value of speed but located alongside non-zero power values and there are a few that are associated with medium and higher speed values of speed. Most of the data points in the dataset are unique values. The one datapoint with a zero speed value has a zero power value as expected.\n",

    ">Neural nets are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns to perform some task by analyzing training examples.\n",
    ">Modeled loosely on the human brain, a neural net consists of thousands or even millions of simple processing nodes that are densely interconnected. Most of today’s neural nets are organized into layers of nodes, and they’re “feed-forward,” meaning that data moves through them in only one direction. An individual node might be connected to several nodes in the layer beneath it, from which it receives data, and several nodes in the layer above it, to which it sends data.\n",
    ">To each of its incoming connections, a node will assign a number known as a “weight.” When the network is active, the node receives a different data item — a different number — over each of its connections and multiplies it by the associated weight. It then adds the resulting products together, yielding a single number. If that number is below a threshold value, the node passes no data to the next layer. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node “fires,” which in today’s neural nets generally means sending the number — the sum of the weighted inputs — along all its outgoing connections.\n",
    "When a neural net is being trained, all of its weights and thresholds are initially set to random values. Training data is fed to the bottom layer — the input layer — and it passes through the succeeding layers, getting multiplied and added together in complex ways, until it finally arrives, radically transformed, at the output layer. During training, the weights and thresholds are continually adjusted until training data with the same labels consistently yield similar outputs.\n",

    "Some notes from the lectures:\n",
    "A dataset contains variables, some inputs and outputs. Categorical data, text and image data must first be encoded into floating point numbers. Outputs can be reverse decoded later. Weights are applied to each connection between layers, low weights near 0 meaning that the route is not important while higher values mean this route is important. \n",
    "Some of the dataset can be held back for testing. \n",
    "Neural networks have several layers. The input layer is really a non-layer of neurons with just the inputs. You just provide the input layer to the neural network and this is really the only place the input comes into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers and output layers have proper neurons.\n",
    "The weights and bias are the paramters of the model, you can tweak them to get the neural network to perform better. Often the initial weights might be set to small random values between 0 and 1. \n",
    "Neural networks cares more about the connections between the nodes than the actual nodes themselves. Looks at the signal times the weights for each of the inputs. `w * x` for each input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bias significes how important something is and is just a number on top of weight times input for each neuron. \n",
    "With neural networks you want to get a high value assigned to the correct output. If the neural network misclassifies an output label then you just feed it back into the algorithm, the weights are changed a little so that the correct output is predicted the next time. It will keep changing until it gets the correct output. \n",
    "Starts out with random values for the weights. These are updated slowly over time to get towards the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is the algorithm through which the weights are updated. Stochastic gradient descent (`sgd`).\n",
    "Each output from each neuron is the same but when the different weights are applied, what is received by the nodes in the next layer are different to what left the nodes on the previous layer.\n",
    "The loss is the cost function, often the MSE mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear function y = x is just a simple function where you give it a single input and expect the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the neural network is trained and is stable, you can then take a new input, a new datapoint it was not trained on and the neural network should correctly classify it.\n",

    "A model has a life-cycle with 5 steps:\n",
    "1. Define the model: \n",
    "Select the type of model and choose the architecture or network topology. Define the number of layers, configure each layer with a number of nodes and activation function, connect the layers together into a cohesive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compile the model\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This requires selecting a **loss function** that you want to optimise such as mean squared error and to select an algorithm to perform the **optimisation** procedure such as stochastic gradient descent or a modern variation of this called Adam. Also you can select the **performance metrics**  to keep track of during the model training process.\n",
    "    * Call a function to compile the model with the selected configuration to prepare the appropriate data structures required for the efficient use of the selected model. \n",
    "    * The optimizer can be specified as a string for a known optimizer class such as `sgd` for stochastic gradient descent or else you can configure an instance of the optimizer class to use. See [optimizer classes](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `sgd` - Gradient descent (with momentum) optimizer. The default learning rate is 0.01\n",
    "    The update rule is ` w = w - learning_rate * g` for parameter `w` with  gradient `g` when momentum is 0.\n",
    "    * \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam]\n",
    "    *  The `learning_rate` defaults to 0.001 in the Adam optimizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Loss Functions: class MeanSquaredError: Computes the mean of squares of errors between labels and predictions.\n",
    "    The mean squared error is the one I will be using. There are many more listed in the [keras losses](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses) documentation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Metrics to evaluate predictions such as `Accuracy`  which calculates how often predictions equal labels, `AUC` computes the approximate area under the curve,  `FalseNegatives` which calculates the number of false negatives and `FalsePositives` calculates the number of false positives, `Precision` computes the precision of the predictions with respect to the labels. \n",
    "    There are many more [metrics](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics) which I will come back when I get to that point...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fit the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To fit the model you need to select the training configuration such as the number of epochs which are loops through the training dataset. The batch size is the number of samples in an epoch used to estimate model error.\n",
    "(By passing in say 10 at a time instead of 1 at a time can have a smoothing effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "Training applies the chosen optimization algorithm to minimize the chosen loss function and updates the model using the backpropagation of error algorithm. This can be slow depending on the complexity of the model, the size of the training dataset and the hardware being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another machine learning article here on [the importance of batch sizes](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-control-the-speed-and-stability-of-training-neural-networks-with-gradient-descent-batch-size/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the holdout dataset comes into play, data that is not used in the training of the model so you can get an unbiased estimate of the performance of the model when making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make predictions\n",
    "This is the final stage of the life cycle where you take values that you don't have target values and make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential model\n",
    "A **sequential** model adds layers to the model one by one in a linear manner, from input to output.\n",
    "    The visible layer of the network is defined by the input shape argument on the first hidden layer. In the wind dataset this will be `(1,)` - the model will expect the input for one sample to be a vector of 1 number.\n",
    "`model.add()` is used to add each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a functional model which is more complex but more flexible. It involves explicitly connecting the output of one layer to the input of another layer. Each connection is specified. I will be using the sequential model for this project.\n",

    "###  Develop Multilayer Perceptron Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A Multilayer Perceptron model (MLP)is a standard fully connected neural network model. It is made up of one or more (dense) layers of nodes where each node is connected to all outputs from the previous layer and the output of each node is connected to all the inputs for the nodes in the next layer. This model is suitable for tabular data and can be used for three predictive modeling problems being binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression. \n",

The preprocessing should ideally be done as part of the model to make it more portable in production. In Keras the preprocessing is done via preprocessing layers which can be included directly into your model either during training or after training.

It helps determine if the model is learning well and whether it is underfitting or overfitting the training set.To do this you need to update the call to to the `fit` function to include a reference to a validation dataset which is a portion of the training dataset not used to fit the model but instead used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. The fit function will then return a history object containing a trace of performance metrics recorded at the end of each training epoch.

According to the tutorial, Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions were the preferred choice  for all layers before but that these days better performance is achieved using the ReLU activation function.

    "An artificial neuron calculates a weighted sum of its input, adds a bias and then decides whether it should be fired or not. $ Y = \\sum{(\\text{weight} * \\text{input})} + \\text{bias}$\n",
    "The value of Y can be anything from -infinity to + infinity. The neuron does not really know the bounds of the value. So how do we decide whether the neuron should fire or not? This is where the activation functions come in. The activation function will check the Y value produced by the neuron and decide whether outside connections should consider this neuron as activated (fired) or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a threshold based activation function. If the value of Y is above a certain value then it could declare it as activated, otherwise not. In this case the output is 1 (activated) when the value is greater than than the threshold and 0 otherwise. This is a step function. There are drawbacks to using this method as an activation function for neural networks though when the response is not a binary yes or no.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear activation function A = cx is a straight line function where activation is proportional to input ( which is the weighted sum from neuron ). In this way it will give a range of activations rather than just binary activations. We can connect some neurons and if more than one fire then we could take the max and decide based on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative w.r.x is c which means that the gradient has no relationship with X. The descent is going to be on a constant gradient. If there is an error in prediction the changes made by back propagation is constant and not depending on the change in input delta(x).\n",
    "Another problem concerns the connected layers where each layer is activated by a linear function. \n",
    "That activation in turn goes into the next level as input and the second layer calculates weighted sum on that input and it in turn, fires based on another linear activation function.\n",
    "No matter how many layers we have, if all are linear in nature, the final activation function of last layer is nothing but just a linear function of the input of first layer. Therefore two or more layers can be replaced by a single layer. The whole network then is equivalent to  a single layer with linear activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thw sigmoid function is smooth and looks somewhat like a step function. It is nonlinear in nature and therefore combinations of layers are also non-linear which means that layers can be stacked. It will also give non binary activations unlike the step function. It has a smooth gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between X values -2 to 2, the Y values are very steep.This means that any small changes in the values of X in that region will cause values of Y to change significantly.This means this function has a tendency to bring the Y values to either end of the curve.\n",
    "It tends to bring the activations to either side of the curve making clear distinctions on prediction. Another advantage over linear function is that the output of the activation function is always going to be in range (0,1) compared to (-inf, inf) of linear function and therefore the activations are bound in a range. \n",
    "Sigmoid functions are one of the most widely used activation functions today. The problems with them is that towards either end of the sigmoid function, the Y values tend to respond very less to changes in X. This means that the gradient at that region is going to be small. It gives rise to a problem of “vanishing gradients”. When the activations reach near the “near-horizontal” part of the curve on either sides, the gradient is small or has vanished ( cannot make significant change because of the extremely small value ). The network refuses to learn further or is drastically slow ( depending on use case and until gradient /computation gets hit by floating point value limits ). There are ways to work around this problem and sigmoid is still very popular in classification problems.\n",
    "The article also looked at the Tanh activation functions which is a scaled sigmoid function and the ReLu function which gives an output x if x is positive and 0 otherwise. These are both non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article finishes by suggesting how to choose the correct activation function. \n",
    "When you know the function you are trying to approximate has certain characteristics, you can choose an activation function which will approximate the function faster leading to faster training process. For example, a sigmoid works well for a classifier "
